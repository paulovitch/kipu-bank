# 🏦 KipuBank

### A minimal ETH vault contract built for educational purposes (Module 2 – ETH Kipu Bootcamp).

---

## 📜 Overview

KipuBank is a smart contract that allows users to **deposit and withdraw native ETH** into personal vaults, 
while enforcing both a **per-transaction withdrawal cap** and a **global deposit limit (bankCap)**.

It was designed and deployed as the final project of Module 2 to demonstrate:
- secure contract architecture using **custom errors**,  
- adherence to **Checks → Effects → Interactions (CEI)** pattern,  
- proper use of **modifiers** and **NatSpec**,  
- and clean, auditable code structure.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🧱 **Immutable configuration**  
  - `withdrawPerTxCap` and `bankCap` are set once at deployment.
- 💰 **Deposits and Withdrawals**  
  - Users can deposit ETH into a personal vault (`deposit()`).
  - Withdrawals are limited by `withdrawPerTxCap` (`withdraw()`).
- 🔐 **Global deposit limit**  
  - Prevents total vault value from exceeding `bankCap`.
- 🧩 **Events & Tracking**  
  - Emits `Deposited` and `Withdrawn` events for every transaction.
  - Tracks total deposits and withdrawals with on-chain counters.
- 🧯 **Security**  
  - Uses **custom errors** instead of `require` strings.
  - Respects **least privilege** and encapsulation.
  - **Rejects direct ETH transfers** via `receive()` and `fallback()`.

## 🧰 Tech & Design Patterns

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Validation | Custom errors + Modifiers |
| Logic Flow | Checks → Effects → Interactions |
| Gas Optimization | `unchecked` blocks for safe counters |
| Visibility | `private` state + explicit getters |
| Documentation | Full **NatSpec** coverage |
| Security | CEI + no reentrancy risk |

## 🧪 Deployment

### 1. Compile
Use **Remix IDE** or **Hardhat** with Solidity `^0.8.19`.

### 2. Deploy parameters
When deploying, provide:

```solidity
constructor(uint256 _withdrawPerTxCap, uint256 _bankCap)


Example:

withdrawPerTxCap = 0.2 ether
bankCap = 5 ether

🔍 Verified Contract

Network: Sepolia Testnet

Address: 0xYOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS

Compiler Version: 0.8.19

EVM Version: Default

License: MIT

(Replace with your actual verified contract address.)

💻 Interaction
Deposit ETH

Call:

deposit()


Send ETH along with the call (msg.value > 0).

Withdraw ETH

Call:

withdraw(uint256 amount)


Must be ≤ your vault balance.

Must be ≤ withdrawPerTxCap.

Read data
Function	Description
balanceOf(address)	Returns vault balance of user
totalVaulted()	Returns total ETH stored
totalDeposits()	Number of successful deposits
totalWithdrawals()	Number of successful withdrawals
getWithdrawPerTxCap()	Returns withdraw cap per tx
getBankCap()	Returns global deposit cap
🔒 Security Considerations

No external calls in deposit().

withdraw() follows CEI and checks for transfer success.

receive() and fallback() revert all direct ETH transfers.

No reentrancy risk (no untrusted external calls before state updates).

Gas-efficient counter updates with unchecked.
